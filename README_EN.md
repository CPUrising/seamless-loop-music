# Seamless Loop Music Player

## 📖 Introduction
This tool is designed specifically for game music (BGM) or looping audio assets. It supports frame-perfect sample-point settings to ensure seamless transitions for `.wav`, `.mp3`, and `.ogg` files. Built on .NET Framework 4.8 for native Windows compatibility.

## 🚀 Usage
1. **Import Assets**: Click "Import Music Folder" to select a directory containing your audio files.
2. **Select Tracks**: Double-click in the playlist or use "Prev/Next" buttons to switch tracks.
3. **Adjust Loop Points**:
    - Enter samples or seconds directly in the input fields.
    - Use the fine-tuning buttons (e.g., `-1s`, `+500`) for precise adjustments.
4. **Verify Transition**: Click "Apply & Preview" to apply settings; the player will jump to 3 seconds before the loop end for verification.
5. **Replay**: Click "Replay" to instantly restart playback from the 0ms position.
6. **Auto Save**: All loop settings are automatically saved to a local configuration file.
